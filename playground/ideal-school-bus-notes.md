## Session Notes

- **Time stamp:** (fill when continuing)  
- **Objective:** Recreate the reference school bus illustration inside the shared Figma file using rectangles, strokes, and text.

### Canvas Setup Thoughts
- Current Figma page (`0:1` / "Page 1") is empty; plan to create a dedicated frame named `School Bus Build` near origin for organization.
- Frame size target: roughly 800×400 so the bus fits with padding for exporting.

### Build Strategy
1. Lay down main bus body as rounded rectangle (bright yellow).
2. Add lower body panel and stripe using stacked rectangles.
3. Create wheels (circles with layered strokes) and wheel wells.
4. Add windows and door details (rectangles with light blue fill).
5. Finish with text label and lights/bumpers.

### Change Log
- Created frame `School Bus Build` (800×400) as working area at origin.
- Added rounded rectangle `Bus Body` (700×180, yellow fill) centered horizontally within frame.
- Added `Window Band` lighter yellow rectangle (660×70) positioned near top of bus body to anchor window row.

### Next Session Reminders
- Keep exporting after each mutation to stay aligned with the reference.
- Update this log whenever making progress so it's easy to resume.
