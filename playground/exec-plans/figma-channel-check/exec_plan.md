# ExecPlan: Figma Channel Connectivity Check
Created: 2025-10-24
Status: In Progress
Last Updated: 2025-10-24

## Why It Matters
Confirming the MCP bridge can reach the Figma plugin ensures subsequent design automation tasks will succeed without additional setup work.

## Current Context
- Plugin channel provided by user: `e56nd4kd`.
- Repository includes MCP tools (`join_channel`, `figma`, `get_subscription_events`) for interacting with the Figma canvas.
- No prior confirmation that this workspace is connected to the specified Figma file.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Join Figma channel `e56nd4kd` without errors.
- [ ] Create a rectangle node on the connected canvas.
- [ ] Export an image reflecting the new rectangle and store it under `/tmp` for confirmation.
- [ ] Provide confirmation to the user referencing the exported image.

## Work Overview
Leverage the MCP Figma tools to join the provided channel, create the rectangle, export a screenshot, and report results back to the user.

## Milestone 1: Establish Channel Connection
**Scope:** Confirm we can communicate with the Figma plugin over the provided channel.
**Steps:**
1. Use `join_channel` tool with `channel: "e56nd4kd"`.
2. If errors arise, troubleshoot using plugin manifest or docs.
**Validation:** Successful response from `join_channel` (no error message).
**Rollback/Fallback:** Retry with corrected channel string or ask human if connection fails repeatedly.
**Status:** Complete

## Milestone 2: Create Rectangle and Capture Image
**Scope:** Add a rectangle to the canvas and export a screenshot showing the change.
**Steps:**
1. Call `figma` with `path: "figma"` and `method: "createRectangle"`.
2. Request export via `figma` or plugin method per instructions, saving to `/tmp/figma-channel-check.png`.
3. Verify the file exists locally.
**Validation:** Rectangle creation call returns node data; screenshot saved at `/tmp/figma-channel-check.png`.
**Rollback/Fallback:** If rectangle creation fails, re-run after verifying selection state; delete created node if unintended via plugin tooling.
**Status:** Blocked

## Milestone 3: Report Results
**Scope:** Communicate success and reference evidence to the user.
**Steps:**
1. Summarize actions taken and note screenshot path.
2. Update plan progress markers (success criteria and statuses).
**Validation:** User provided with confirmation referencing exported image.
**Rollback/Fallback:** If earlier milestones incomplete, return to them before reporting.
**Status:** Not Started

## Progress Log
- 2025-10-24 – Plan drafted; awaiting execution.
- 2025-10-24 – Joined channel `e56nd4kd`.
- 2025-10-24 – Blocked on rectangle creation; manifest lacks `figma.*` methods.

## Decision Log
- 2025-10-24 – Saved exported image as `/tmp/figma-channel-check.png` for easy reference.

## Validation Summary
- [ ] Rectangle created via `figma.createRectangle`.
- [ ] Screenshot located at `/tmp/figma-channel-check.png`.

## Risks & Follow-Ups
- Channel may be stale or disconnected; will require human confirmation if join fails.
- Plugin manifest from channel `e56nd4kd` does not expose Figma API methods (`figma.*`), preventing node creation.

## Handoff Notes
Resume with Milestone 1 if not yet completed; ensure screenshot step executes immediately after rectangle creation.

## Upon Completion
- permanently_terminate_session called: false
